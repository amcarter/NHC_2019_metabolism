NHC data paper and Hall 50 years later 2019

##Writing


##Data
-work up real sensor offsets based on NHC_YSI file
-enter data from Q measurements along NHC
-work up mesocosm data
-work up DOC/TN data
-get lachat ID sheet from 12/05 run to find sample names (look and see if these are in the DOC file)
-find chem data from first longitudinal sampling

## Lab work
-run samples from NHC sites 12/2019-3/2020
-run MC751 samples

##DataAnalysis
Discharge
-Calculate Q for MC751
-Calculate velocity/MRT from cross sections
 - get stage at each site from LL

GasFlux
-Recalculate nighttime regression using RocherRos github
-calculate gas flux: compare with bucket data?  
-calculate gas slopes at each tp: what does this have to do with MC data?

-cluster analysis of time raw timeseries.
-look at raw data discontinuities: 
  does this differ systematically between gas and aqueous solutes?
-NMDS/PCA of solute data
-make 3D plots of raw data:
	x:DOY, Q, temp; Y:[solute]; z:river distance
- make CQ plots of everything for each site superimposed

Metabolism
-Look at model results, compare to Streampulse package output
-Look over model fits, rerun with different K prior?
-Rerun SM with hand pooling of K measurements

##Plots


##Field
-measure pool dimensions
-measure travel time between sensors

##General
Add table for mesocosm data

##Hall 50 years
-list of potential takehomes (1 pom)

5/7/2020

	Update discharge interpolation 
	find gaps in Q data
	fill with lines to snap interp dat
	deal with special cases

	Run stream metabolizer for all the sites
	save smaller version of RDS output
	code DYgraphs for comparing DO meas vs modeled
compare DO modeled vs measured for all days
