NHC greenhouse gas paper to do:

#### Writing
 - flesh out introduction

#### Data Prep
 - compile all manual cross section flow measurements from NHC
 - Find if there were cation measurements from the first half of sampling
 - Compile all ghg atmospheric measurements ever taken

Gas buckets
 - organize gas samples data from bucket deployments (July 2018, Mar 2019)
 - locate bucket volume calculations
 - locate temperature logger data

Diel gas sampling:
 - locate diel gas data from NHC in 2017
 - locate diel gas data from bucket deployments


#### Calculations
Discharge and Metabolism
 - Fix discharge at NHC site
   - Recalculate Q interpolation, 
     - Recalculate metabolism with SM
     - Extend metabolism estimates at NHC and UNHC to the end of March 2020

Gas Flux
 - Calculate gas flux from buckets
 - compare 24hr flux to bucket sampling every 3 hrs

Mass Balance
 - Calculate expected GW gas inputs between each pair of sites
   - compare to GW water inputs
   - Compare deviations from this relationship to concavity and anaerobic metrics
 - calculate DOC uptake
   - compare to aerobic respiration/CO2 instream production
   - compare deviations from this to anaerobic metrics.
 - Calculate WRT in each reach at each time point
   - compare to metabolism estimates
   - compare to excess CO2 production and anaerobic metrics

Continuous CO2
   - compare CO2:O2 slope to Q, temperature, anaerobic metrics. 

Scaling
 - scale flux estimates to the whole reach
 - do MCMC uncertainty analysis for each of these things

#### Plots 								Done
									- regression with drivers
								 	- concentration ranges and fluxes over space and time
   									- boxplot of conc x site, lineplot of flux x site

 									- CO2 vs O2
			  					 	- color by Q, T
   									- bin by Q, T
								   	- plot for grab samples at sites
 - Excess CO2: GW
   - residuals: concavity, anaerobic mets

 - delta DOC x respiration
   - residuals: conc, anaerobic mets

 - WRT:Met, WRT:anaerobic mets
   - site specific slopes vs reach concavity.


Done
 - download NHC CO2 and O2 sensor data, make a data frame with temp, Q and spC
 - get "anaerobic metrics" from drought paper gomez gener
 - Calculate CO2 and O2 sat for each tp
   - calculate slope of excess concentrations
   - is more excess CO2 associated with higher or lower water residence times?
Regression
 - Concentrations and Fluxes versus drivers. Make summary tables of regression outputs
